Pynfc - Python C bindings for libnfc
====================================

Requirements
------------
- libnfc >= 1.7.1
- python >= 3.0

Building and Setup
------------------
The bindings are constructed at runtime using ctypes.
Please ensure that libnfc is correctly installed in one of the system default
paths.

To install this library, just run `python setup.py install` in `src/` directory.

Documentation
-------------
pynfc3 offers basic C bindings for the API of libnfc. There is no proper wrapper
to facilitate the data exchange with Python right now.

Using this library needs some experience with ctypes. Nevertheless, it is not so
hard :)
